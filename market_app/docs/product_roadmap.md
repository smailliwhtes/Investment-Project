# Novice‑First Monitoring App Roadmap (No‑Nonsense, No‑Advice)

This roadmap focuses on a **streamlined, beginner‑friendly monitoring experience** that does **not** provide investment advice or execute trades.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Plain English** over jargon.
2. **Actionable context**, not directives.
3. **Transparent scoring** (every score has a reason).
4. **Defensive defaults** (risk warnings > hype).

---

## Phase 1 — Clarity & Trust

- **Explain‑the‑score cards** (why each symbol scores the way it does).
- **Risk flag glossary** (RED/AMBER + human‑readable reasons).
- **Data freshness indicator** (how recent the data is).
- **Reliability tags** (e.g., “insufficient history”).

---

## Phase 2 — Streamlined Workflow

- **Quick start watchlist** template.
- **One‑click scan** (watchlist → scored output).
- **Saved runs** (track changes between runs).
- **Simple export** (CSV + Markdown summary).

---

## Phase 3 — Education Without Advice

- **Mini explainers** for metrics (volatility, drawdown, momentum).
- **Macro overlays** (interest rates, CPI, GDP) for context only.
- **Scenario cards** (e.g., “tech‑tilt,” “defense‑tilt”) with plain English.

---

## Phase 4 — ML‑Ready Datasets (Optional)

If you want to feed models:

- **Curated datasets** with consistent schema.
- **Feature store** for reusable indicators.
- **Reproducible manifests** for every dataset build.

## Guardrail Language (Example)

> “This tool provides monitoring signals and data summaries. It does not provide investment advice. Decisions remain yours.”

This sentence (or similar) should appear in the README, CLI help, and any UI/exports.
